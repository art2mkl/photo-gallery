We'll create a Photo Gallery app that offers the ability to take photos with your device's camera, display them in a grid, and store them permanently on the device.

Highlights include:

One Angular-based codebase that runs on the web, iOS, and Android using Ionic Framework UI components.
Deployed as an Android mobile app using Capacitor, Ionic's official native app runtime.
Photo Gallery functionality powered by the Capacitor Camera, Filesystem, and Storage APIs.
